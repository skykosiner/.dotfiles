# Dotfiles
* I'm using stow to manage my dotfiles
* There is some weird ~ generated by vim swap files, I'm too scared to touch it

## What I'm using
* DWM as my windo manger (https://github.com/skykosiner/dwm)
    * DWM blocks for the statusbar (https://github.com/skykosiner/dwmblocks)
* Emacs as my main code editor
* Neovim for quick file edits
* St for my terminal (https://github.com/skykosiner/st)
* Lf for my file manager
* Qutebrowser for my browser
* Zsh as my main shell (yes I use oh-my-zsh, no I don't care what you think about it)
* Zauthura as my pdf viewer

## Personal note
* To update spotify albums use [this](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-current-user-saved-albums/)
