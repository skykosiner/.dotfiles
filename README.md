# Dotfiles
* I'm using stow to manage my dotfiles
* There is some weird ~ generated by vim swap files, I'm too scared to touch it

## What I'm using
* DWM as my window manger (https://github.com/skykosiner/dwm)
    * DWM blocks for the statusbar (https://github.com/skykosiner/dwmblocks)
* Neovim as my main text editor
* St for my terminal (https://github.com/skykosiner/st)
* Lf for my file manager
* Brave as my browser
* Zsh as my main shell
* Zauthura as my pdf viewer

## Personal note
* To update spotify albums use [this](https://developer.spotify.com/web*api/console/get*current*user*saved*albums/)
