* Dotfiles
- I'm using stow to manage my dotfiles
- There is some weird ~ generated by vim swap files, I'm too scared to touch it

** What I'm using
- DWM as my windo manger (https://github.com/skykosiner/dwm)
    - DWM blocks for the statusbar (https://github.com/skykosiner/dwmblocks)
- Emacs as my main code editor
- Neovim for quick file edits
- St for my terminal (https://github.com/skykosiner/st)
- Lf for my file manager
- Qutebrowser for my browser
  - Qutebrowser has a weird glitch with discord stuff so I have brave around discord
    - And also brave is better for when doing web dev work
- Zsh as my main shell
- Zauthura as my pdf viewer

** Personal note
- To update spotify albums use [this](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-current-user-saved-albums/)
